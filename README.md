### About
Gapps is an Security compliance platform that makes it easy to track your progress against various security frameworks. *Gapps is currently in Alpha mode - while it works great, there may be some breaking changes as it evolves. Please do not use this in production.... yet!*.  
- Supports 10 security compliance frameworks (more coming)  
- 1500+ controls and 25+ policies out of the box for the frameworks (majority of policies are sourced from [strongdm/comply](https://github.com/strongdm/comply))
- Track the status of each control
- Add custom controls/policies
- WYSIWYG content editor  
- Vendor questionnaires

### Getting Started

##### Setting up the server with Docker in 2 minutes

The following instructions are to get you started very quickly. The image will be pulled from Docker Hub

```
$ git clone https://github.com/bmarsh9/gapps.git; cd gapps
$ docker-compose up -d
```

The server should be running on `http://<your-ip>:5000`  
The default email/password is `admin@example.com:admin`

Next, create a Tenant and a Project with you desired framework (e.g. SOC2). Based on the selected criteria, controls and policies will be automatically added to your project. Start exploring your project!

##### Email  

You can setup email (for sending user invites) as well by setting the following environment variables (docker-compose file or elsewhere)  

```
MAIL_USERNAME="email@gmail.com"
MAIL_PASSWORD="app password" # https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en
```

### Supported frameworks
+ ISO27001


### Roadmap

[Take a look at the project](https://github.com/users/bmarsh9/projects/1)


### Things to know
- The mitigation details of the controls are not documented. So it won't tell you how to mitigate a specific control. This requires a ton of work to complete but there is a ticket
- Difficulty to Implement (dtc) is a field attached to the controls and every single control is labeled as "Easy" (that doesn't actually mean it is easy). This also requires a ton of work to update.


### FAQ

##### If you get a database connection error trying to start Gapps, you need to update (or remove) your env variables
```
[INFO] Checking if we can connect to the database server: postgresql://db1:db1@localhost/db1
[ERROR] could not connect to server: Connection refused
        Is the server running on host "localhost" (127.0.0.1) and accepting
        TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
could not connect to server: Cannot assign requested address
        Is the server running on host "localhost" (::1) and accepting
        TCP/IP connections on port 5432?
```

Can usually be fixed by unsetting two variables if running within docker. If you want to use a external database, see the next FAQ
```
unset SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI
unset POSTGRES_HOST
```

##### Set env variables for the database connection

The value `db1` is the default value for the username, database and password. If you would like to change it, update `db1` with the respective values and `postgres` for the host.
```
export POSTGRES_HOST=${POSTGRES_HOST:-postgres}
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-db1}
export POSTGRES_USER=${POSTGRES_USER:-db1}
export POSTGRES_DB=${POSTGRES_DB:-db1}
export SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI="postgresql://db1:db1@postgres/db1"
```

##### Resetting the database
When starting Gapps for the first time, it will automatically create the database models. If you want to reset the data (e.g. delete all data), you can set the `RESET_DB` env variable such as `export RESET_DB=yes`.

##### Running Gapps for development
Sometimes you may want to run Gapps outside of Docker. You can do this by starting the Postgres container and then starting Gapps in the foreground.

1. Uncomment ports declaration [here](https://github.com/bmarsh9/gapps/blob/e8dd926fb946e47fa66f918afa543c535ae212be/docker-compose.yml#L59)
2. Start the postgres container: `docker-compose up -d postgres`
3. Set the following env variables:
```
export POSTGRES_HOST=${POSTGRES_HOST:-localhost}
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-db1}
export POSTGRES_USER=${POSTGRES_USER:-db1}
export POSTGRES_DB=${POSTGRES_DB:-db1}
export SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI="postgresql://db1:db1@localhost/db1"
```
4. Run `export FLASK_CONFIG=development;bash run.sh` 
5. Gapps should be running and connected to the database. You can now make changes to the code.

##### Running with Docker Desktop
1. Download the [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/bmarsh9/gapps/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) file
2. Open up a elevated command prompt and change directories (cd) to where the docker-compose.yml file was downloaded (likely Downloads)
3. Run `docker compose up`

##### View env variables for debugging
```
docker exec -e ONESHOT=yes gapps env
```

##### Perform database migration
```
docker exec -e INIT_MIGRATE=yes -e MIGRATE=yes -e ONESHOT=yes gapps bash run.sh
```
**OR**
```
docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it gapps bash
python3 manage.py db migrate
python3 manage.py db stamp head
python3 manage.py db upgrade
exit
```

##### Creating database manually

Warning - this will delete all data in the database!  
```
docker exec -it gapps bash
python3 tools/check_db_connection.py
python3 tools/check_db_models.py
python3 manage.py init_db
```

##### Upgrading versions
1.) Edit `docker-compose.yml` file with the desired version from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/bmarsh13/gapps/tags). Anywhere you see the old version in the compose file (should be 4 instances), update it with the desired version. (e.g. bmarsh13/gapps:3.3.9 -> bmarsh13/gapps:3.4.0)  
2.) `docker-compose up -d`  
3.) [Perform database migration](https://github.com/bmarsh9/gapps#perform-database-migration) if neccesary 

##### Loading new frameworks into Gapps

You can always create a new Framework and controls within the UI - but this would take a long time. Instead, you can load a JSON file into Gapps. 

The format consists of controls and subcontrols. The snippet below shows an example of a control having one (1) subcontrol however you can add as many as you like. It is not a requirement to have subcontrols for a control (you can have zero). However it may make sense if you want to break down a control into specific actions that are trackable. Let's take the CIS 18 framework as an example. You could place all 18 "domains" as controls and the controls within each domain would be a subcontrol within Gapps.

```
[
    {
        "name": "Limit information system access to authorized users, processes acting on behalf of authorized users or",       
        "description": "Maintain list of authorized users defining their identity and associated role and sync with sys",       
        "guidance": "List approved users, services, and devices, and have logical controls in place to prevent unauthor",
        "ref_code": "AC.L1-3.1.1",
        "system_level": false,
        "subcategory": "Identity & Access Management (IAM)",
        "category": "Access Control",
        "dti": "easy",
        "dtc": "easy",
        "meta": {},
        "subcontrols": [
            {
                "ref_code": "3.1.1.a",
                "name": "Authorized users are identified.",
                "description": "Authorized users are identified.",
                "meta": {},
                "tasks": [
                    {
                        "title": "title of the task",
                        "description": "description of the task"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Next, save the above JSON format into a file (such as `my_framework.json` but it must end with `.json`). The name of your framework will be taken from the filename when Gapps loads it (`my_framework` in this case). Save the file in the `app/files/base_controls/` directory. You can also change the load directory by setting the `FRAMEWORK_FOLDER` env variable. Once your new framework is saved to a file and sitting in the framework directory, you can go ahead and create a new Tenant within the UI. Gapps will load your framework automatically. If you want to add a framework to a existing Tenant, go to the "Tenants" page, edit the Tenant and click the "Reload Frameworks" button.

##### Building and pushing
```
docker build -t gapps:3.4.3 .
docker tag gapps:3.4.3 bmarsh13/gapps:3.4.3
docker push bmarsh13/gapps:3.4.3
